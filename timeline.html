                Trance music has evolved significantly since its emergence in the early 1990s. Originating from the early techno and house scenes, trance quickly developed a distinct sound characterized by fast tempos, hypnotic beats, and melodic progressions. Early pioneers like Paul van Dyk, Tiesto, and Ferry Corsten helped shape the foundational uplifting and progressive trance sounds, with tracks that focused on euphoric buildups and emotional releases. As the genre gained popularity in Europe, it became synonymous with large-scale festivals and a global dance music culture, with the iconic "four-to-the-floor" beat becoming a hallmark of its sound.
